## About me

I am grateful husband and the father of two beautiful boys. I have a lifetime of technology experience and 12 years professional experience with IBM, American Express and Cerner in the United Kingdom and Australia.


**Technology has always been my passion**. I am constantly exploring how established and emerging technologies are being applied around the world. I am happiest when I am able to apply what I have learned to enhance the lives of my family and friends. I am currently focused on using voice to unlock the convenience, safety and efficiency benefits of our smart home.


In 2006, I completed an **undergraduate internship with IBM and American Express**. IBM provided American Express with strategic and managed technology services. My team was responsible for managing business-critical technology failures. We leveraged IT Service Management (ITSM) best practices to minimise business disruption, understand root cause and implement changes.  Having to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of business and technical teams across both companies taught me the **benefits of partnership** over more traditional business models.
