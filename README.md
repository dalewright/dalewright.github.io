## About me

I am loving **husband** and the **father** of two beautiful boys.

I have a **lifetime of technology experience** and **12 years professional experience** with **IBM** (managed technology services) and **Cerner** (healthcare technology products and services). I have worked across the **United Kingdom** and **Australia**.

**Technology has always been my passion**. I am constantly exploring how established and emerging technologies are being applied around the world. I am fulfilled when I am able to apply what I have learned to enhance the lives of my family and friends. I am currently focused on using **voice** to unlock the benefits of our smart home.
