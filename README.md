I am a grateful husband and father of two. I have a lifetime of technology experience and 12 years of professional experience with IBM and Cerner in the UK and Australia.

Technology has always been my passion. I am constantly exploring how established and emerging technologies are being applied around the world. I am happiest when I can apply what I have learned to enhance the lives of my family and friends. I am currently focused on using voice to unlock the convenience, safety and efficiency benefits of our smart home.

In 2006, I completed an undergraduate internship with IBM and American Express. IBM provided American Express with strategic and managed technology services. My team was responsible for managing business-critical technology failures. We leveraged IT Service Management (ITSM) best practices to minimise business disruption, understand the root cause and implement changes. Coordinating the activities of business and technical teams across two large companies taught me how to establish and maintain genuine partnerships.

In 2007, I received an honours degree from Nottingham Business. Shortly after, I joined Cerner. Cerner is a leading provider of technology products and services in the health care industry. I chose Cerner because my mother was a nurse and I understood the challenges and rewards of being a clinician. I knew I could make a difference.
