## About me

>I am grateful husband and the father of two beautiful boys. I have a lifetime of technology experience and 12 years professional experience with IBM and Cerner in the United Kingdom and Australia.


**Technology has always been my passion**. I am constantly exploring how established and emerging technologies are being applied around the world. I am happiest when I am able to apply what I have learned to enhance the lives of my family and friends. I am currently focused on using voice** and machine learning to unlock the convenience, safety and efficiency benefits of our smart home.


In 2006, I completed a 1 year **undergraduate internship with IBM and American Express**. IBM were American Express's strategic technology partner and provided managed technology services. My team managed all business-critical technology incidents.
